/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership security model for the LoveSpark
 * Calculator application. The core philosophy is that all user-generated data is
 * private and can only be accessed by the user who created it.
 *
 * --- Data Structure ---
 * All user data, specifically calculation results, is nested under a user-specific
 * path: `/users/{userId}/calculations/{calculationId}`. This hierarchical
 * structure inherently isolates each user's data, simplifying security logic
 * and ensuring privacy.
 *
 * --- Key Security Decisions ---
 * - User Data Isolation: A user can only read or write documents within their own
 *   data tree (i.e., under `/users/{their-own-userId}`).
 * - No User Enumeration: Listing the top-level `/users` collection is explicitly
 *   disallowed to prevent leaking user IDs.
 * - Ownership is Path-Based: Authorization is determined by matching the
 *   authenticated user's UID with the `{userId}` segment in the document path. This
 *   avoids the need for extra database reads (`get()`) within the rules, resulting
 *   in faster and more scalable security.
 * - Prototyping Flexibility: These rules enforce strict authorization (who can
 *   access what) but do not validate the specific shape or data types of the
 *   `CalculationResult` documents. This allows for rapid application development
 *   and schema iteration without needing to update security rules for every
 *   minor data model change.
